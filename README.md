## 🤷 What is Smart Query?

Imagine you have a music store database (`Chinook`) with thousands of records about artists, albums, invoices, and customers. Finding specific information usually requires writing code.

**Smart Query changes that.**

It acts as a bridge 🌉 between you and your data. You ask a question, and the AI:

1. **Understands** what you are looking for. 💭
2. **Writes** the safe code (SQL) to find it. ⌨️
3. **Explains** the answer back to you clearly. 🗣️

It's a perfect Natural Language Processing agent for business owners, managers, or anyone who wants data insights without the technical headache!
